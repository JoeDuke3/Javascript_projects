<!-- THE ASSIGNMENT IS TO USE THE BROWSER TO FIND
THE ERROR THAT'S IN THIS CODE, BUT IT'S PRETTY 
PLAIN TO SEE. I EVEN i SAW IT ON THE FIRST TRY (IF THAT'S 
WHAT IT IS...). I'M GONNA FIX IT TO SEE IF I'M RIGHT OR NOT, 
THEN PUT BACK BECAUSE I STILL WANNA SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN THE BROWSER CONSOLE. 
EDIT: THAT WAS IT, NOW TO RE-BREAK IT AND CHECK IT OUT 
IN THE DEVTOOLS CONSOLE... -->
